o better harbor display
o internal trade
o count longest road (2/5) need a test
o reject configs where 6/8 are adjacent (1/5)
o currently, the ressources and tokens are fixed by DelaunayBoard but it should be done by the model (1/5)

x interface of each player hide ressources others
x best army display (number of knights)
x free road card, check all cards
x clean state transition code (3/5)
x better city display
x separate window controlor et applet main (2/5)

x clean old classes after new state transition model

x test state transition (4/5)
several client-actions can be considered 
select a:
-vertex (colony, city)
-edge (road)
-face (thief)
-player (steal)
-ressource (monopole)
-ressources (draw 7)

According to the current game state, the client sends a selection request to the server. The server checks the validity of the request (adjacent road etc...) and if valid updates its model/state and notify the clients (update model for inactive players, updates model/gamestate for active player).

The test can be done by saving a config a try different client action and checking model/gamestate obtained.


x cheat code to add ressource for first player (1/5)
x restrict number of roads/city/...
x free road card
x bug when play knight and click elsewhere, windows does not close and knight can then be played at another time
x cards
-> finish buy cards
-> do ui do spend card with choice
-> test cards
x bug polygons ressources
x first placement -> forbid next far from second colony
  -> pass a constraint class for placement (with decorator)
x harbor/internal trade 
x harbor done
x do exchange when click button
x add button internal/external trade and according states
x steal -> auto select if only 0 or 1 player
-> bug for looseRessources
x test -delaunay-
x test -delaunay board tiles-
x test -model- is build possible, make building, harvest
x register DelTriangle mets les points sur les DelVertices
x choose between datastructure and object
x 1 do a normalised grid
x first placement -> forbid next far from second colony
x first placement -> do first harvest with second colony
x add UI
x ask first choice 
x do main loop
x  select vertex/edge/triangle seems to work
