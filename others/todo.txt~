o restrict number of roads/city/...
o count longest road

o harbor/internal trade 
o cards


x first placement -> forbid next far from second colony
  -> pass a constraint class for placement (with decorator)




-- model
o currently, the ressources and tokens are fixed by DelaunayBoard 
but it should be done by the model 

-- view
o clean viewer (create new class with basic geometric method and 
another with advanced one such as drawColony)


-- tests --

x test -delaunay-
x test -delaunay board tiles-
x test -model- is build possible, make building, harvest

-- bugs --- 
o bug polygons ressources
x register DelTriangle mets les points sur les DelVertices


-- ressources
x choose between datastructure and object




-- grid --
x 1 do a normalised grid


-- UI --

x first placement -> forbid next far from second colony
x first placement -> do first harvest with second colony

=== BIG STEPS ===

x add UI

x ask first choice 

x do main loop
  . ask choices
  . check conditions


  
  
=== Remarks ===
x  select vertex/edge/triangle seems to work
